# Session 7 - Task

This task explores the creation of different objects, created as instances of different classes written by you.

1. Inheritance and Aggregation



2. Super and Final

## Implementing objects
Within the `object` package, in IntelliJ, create a new class.

Name it as any object, begin with simple ones.

For example:
- wallet
- light bulb
- soda can
- coin
- pizza

By simple, I mean understandable. Something that has identifiable features, something that may contain information (pizza has X slices, light bulb is on or off, soda can be opened or not). Identify features that can stored in fields within the class. It could be anything from:
- color
- size
- weight
- height
- position
- temperature
- quantity

Specific state can also be stored as boolean fields, for example:
- isOpen
- isInitialized
- isCeilingFanRunning
- isCold
