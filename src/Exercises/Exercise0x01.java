/**
 * Exercise 0x01
 *
 *  An exercise which introduces concepts such as:
 *      - Types
 *      - Variables
 *      - Values
 *
 *  Java is different from JavaScript, and is by no means related in any way.
 *
 *  In Java, types are needed when declaring variables, before the variable name.
 *  This also holds for parameters in function declarations as well.
 *
 *  JavaScript has a dynamic typing system, where you do not have to
 *  specify the type, as the interpreter figures out the type when
 *  assigning a value to a variable.
 *
 *  In Java however, types are prefixed before variables and parameters.
 *
 *  ---
 *
 *  Short recap:
 *
 *      Variables: for holding data accessible by name
 *
 *          int number = 123;
 *
 *      Arguments: variables a function expects
 *
 *          int addTwoNumbersTogether(int x, int y) {
 *              return x + y;
 *          }
 *
 *      Parameters: data given to functions
 *
 *          int result = addTwoNumbersTogether(1, 2);
 *
 *
 *  But, before that, look at the below code.
 *
 *  Add your own code within the static main method.

/**
 *  Try something out, and to get you started:
 *
 *  In JavaScript, you would use the following to output
 *  any text value into the console:
 *      console.log("Hello, world!");
 *
 *  Using Java:
 *      System.out.println("Hello, world!");
 *
 *  Be aware, println() above adds a \n newline character
 *  at the end of the String value given. Using .print() would not.
 *
 *  Try it out with several System.out.print("text");
 *
 *  Go to the next Exercise after printing several lines of text,
 *  where we will print out values from variables and use this
 *  to do simple calculations.
 *
 *  Use the green arrow to run your code using IntelliJ.
