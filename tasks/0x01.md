Lastly, explore this piece of documentation regarding `String` in Java:
- https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html

What are your initial thoughts when exploring the above link?

I do know that it can be daunting at first, but know this: 
- With time, reading documentation like this will become easier
- You will learn tricks to filter information from documentation sources

For now, pay attention to words and different concepts introduced during lectures.

Getting familiar with terminology and words used, will make scanning documentation 
easier for the information you are looking for.

Please, do not forget:
- Programming requires you to code to grow and maintain your skills of programming.
- Programming is about solving problems, and is a skill you have to maintain.

If you want a simple rule that you can follow, or adapt to your liking:

Do not go more than 24-48 hours without coding.

Good luck, more tasks will be added as we progress through the course!
